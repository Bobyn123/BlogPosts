## Who I am

I'm Robyn Vaughan-Williams, I've been a few things now, student, baker, programmer. I graduated from Aberystwyth university with a degree in space science and robotics, which is a much fancier title than reality.

<!-- Most of my interests lie in using robotics and computers in farming, exploring how they could help produce more food in a sustainable manner. I feel that computers and automation really could help produce a green
world where people can easily afford the bare minimum and find themselves comfortable and happy.

My physical work involves:

- Learning how robotics can work in [real world environments](SailBot.html)
- Experimenting with how we can use computers in [environmentally sustainable](Permacomputing.html) ways,
- Teaching myself to create [low-power/high efficiency programs](ThisSite.html) and robotics,
- Learning about ideas behind farming automation and how we can produce more food whilst keeping our methods sustainable, becoming an active member of communities such as [TwistedFields](https://community.twistedfields.com/t/welcome-to-the-twisted-fields-community-forum/7),

I've been programming for most of my life. My main language is C++, but I also have multiple years of experience in C#, Python and Java and some loose experience in Typescript and C.
