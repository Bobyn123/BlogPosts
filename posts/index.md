Hi, I'm Robyn (Call me Bob)

I've been many things, programmer, student, baker. I spend my productive time programming, repairing things, making pottery, and feeding my friends good food.

This website serves as a intentional digital footprint, a record of past projects, thoughts on the world and generally things I find interesting, as such this website lives and breathes so it's never quite finished.

The world can be a busy mess, but it's important to focus on how we make it better for ourselves and those we share it with. I spend a good amount of my time reading/thinking about the world, how people come together to make something more than ourselves.

Above all else I value **community**, **sustainability**, **equality**.

From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.
