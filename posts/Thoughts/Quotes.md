Below is collection of quotes I either resonate with or am amused by, which of those each is, is left up to the readers discerning:


- “If there had been some tiny bead present in the brain of all humans, that had told each other, They are like you; that had drawn some thin silk thread of empathy, person to person, in a planet-wide net – what might then have happened? Would there have been the same wars, massacres, persecutions and crusades?”― Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Time 


- “providing very high levels of service coupled with a very low, albeit nonzero, level of murder.” ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, Service Model 


- “Ah, yes, hindsight, always my weapon of choice.”― Adrian Tchaikovsky, And Put Away Childish Things 

- “She's learning that getting a proper education doesn't answer questions, it just teaches you to ask them.” ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Memory 


- “None of these things are efficient or logical. I wish to report an error in the way that everything works.”― Adrian Tchaikovsky, Service Model 

- "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron." Dwight D. Eisenhower

- "Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. And then remember this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear." Karis Nemik (Tony Gilroy)

- "And all it meant was this: that there are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal, kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do." -Terry Pratchet, Small Gods

- ["TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPS5Yw_YsHA) - Terry Pratchet, Hogfather

- "No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away - until the clock he wound winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone's life…is only the core of their actual existence." -TerryPratchet, Reaper Man

- "I used to think art had to be great to be worthwhile; now, i only think it has to /be/ to be worthwhile." - John Green
