# Recycled vape battery bank

I hate e-waste and I love free things, so when I found an open source [battery bank]("https://github.com/chrisdoelcreates/vape-power-bank") project and already having a stock of used vapes from friends, I just knew I had to make one for myself.

I was already comfortable with electroncis in general and ordering populated projects from PCBway due to my [VR tracker](Vr-tracker.html) project, so taking the plans and getting some PCBs made was a breeze.

Taking apart some used vapes was a few hours in front of the TV (wear gloves nicotine residue through the skin is no fun) and prepping the batteries with copper tape was a few more hours.

3D printing proved to be surprisingly finicky with a few sad print failures, probably down to the colorful filament.
Wiring the whole thing together and seeing it light up was very satisfying in the end.
