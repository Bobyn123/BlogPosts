# Pottery

I've been going to a weekly pottery workshop for over a year now (see I do go outside), I tend to focus on functional pieces that I can use at home, often in the kitchen.

I'll be using this page to document my process and understanding of the craft as time goes by.
<!-- TODO look into custom CSS override for this page so that images go into a nice gallery -->
here's some of my work in various stages of production.
