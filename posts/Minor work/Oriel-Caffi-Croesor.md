# Working as a baker

During my time at college I sort of fell into a job as a baker at my friends cafe (Oriel Caffi Croesor), up in the welsh mountains. When I say fell into I do almost mean that literally, I just turned up on the cafe's opening day and started helping out, I find it hard to stand idly while I can help my friends, they were good fun to hang out with and I enjoy making delicious sweet treats for people.

I found it all to be a really valuable experience and space to grow as a young adult, gain confidence and independence, eventually they even trusted me with keys so I could come in early to setup, build a fire and bake bread and cakes for the day.
